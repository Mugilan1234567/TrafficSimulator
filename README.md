# ðŸš¦ EcoRoute â€“ Traffic Simulator

EcoRoute is an interactive traffic simulator that lets users design a virtual city and observe realistic car behaviors under different traffic conditions. Built using Python and Pygame, the simulator generates live congestion heatmaps and visualizes the effects of road layouts, stop signs, traffic lights, and time-of-day patterns.

## ðŸŽ¯ Features

- Draw your own city with:
  - Residential and workplace zones
  - Local roads and highways
  - Intersections, stop signs, and traffic lights
- Simulate three time-of-day traffic patterns:
  - **Morning rush** (residential âžœ workplace)
  - **Midday** (lower traffic)
  - **Evening rush** (workplace âžœ residential)
- Animated cars with:
  - Realistic turning and movement
  - Speed changes based on road type
  - Right-side driving behavior
  - Pathfinding logic to determine routes
- Live congestion heatmap overlay
- Car spawning, despawning, and visual debugging tools

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Pygame** â€“ for GUI and animation
- **NumPy** â€“ for heatmap data handling
- **Custom simulation engine** â€“ handles car behavior, timing, and traffic flow
